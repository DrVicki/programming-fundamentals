# Lesson 1: Variables and Constants

- variables store information (like a name or age).

- Constants are unchangeable values (like ```PI = 3.14```.

- Show examples in Python:
```python
name = "John"
age = 25
print(name)
print(age)
```

## ðŸ§ª Activity: Variable Mad Libs Game
**Step-by-Step**:

1. Open Replit and start a new Python project.

2. Add the following starter code:

```
 
# Step 1: Declare variables

name = "Alex"
animal = "dragon"
place = "castle"
verb = "danced"

# Step 2: Use the variables in a story

print("Once upon a time, " + name + " saw a " + animal + " at the " + place + ".")
print("They " + verb + " together until sunset.")

```

3. Run your program to see the output.

4. Change the variable values to create different stories.
5. Optional: Add one constant (e.g., ```MAGIC_WORD = "Abracadabra")```


# Lesson 2 Conditionals

1. Open a new IDE
2. Add this starter code.

```

# Step 1: Get user input

color = input("Pick a color (red, blue, green): ")


# Step 2: Use conditionals

if color == "red":

         print("You will find a surprise today!")

elif color == "blue":

         print("A new opportunity is coming your way.")

elif color == "green":

         print("You will learn something exciting.")

else:
    print("Hmmâ€¦ the future is unclear.")

```

3. Run the program and test with different inputs.
4. Customize it: Add your own questions and responses.


# ðŸ”¹ Lesson 3 Loops (30 min)


ðŸ“– Mini-Lesson:
- Loops repeat code.

- Use ```for``` for a set number of times, ```while``` for repeating until a condition is met.
